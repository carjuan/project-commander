   - An about
   - Doing # What you are currently working on, can be FEATURES, MVP, SPRINKLES, ISSUES/BUGS
   - An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank">MVP</a> outline
   - Features # Great things to have in your app
   - Sprinkles # Anything related to app's styles & UI/UX
   - Issues/bugs
